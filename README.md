# Studying Excited States Using GNNs

This respository contains the code used in our experiments for the CS 159 final project at Caltech. `dataset.py` contains a module `ExcitedDataset`, which loads the azobenzene data. Note that this will take quite some time to download everything. Our experiments are split between `models.py`, `experiments.py`, and `experiments.ipynb`. We performed most of our calculations in the latter. 

The package setup for these files requires the latest version of Pytorch, Pytorch geGeometric, and schnetpack. We include an `environment.yaml` file to make things easier.
